# Running Windows on the Redmi K20 Pro Premium

## Restoring your device in EDL

### Prerequisites
- [Stock fastboot rom](http://xmfirmwareupdater.com/miui/raphael/)

- [EDL drivers](https://github.com/new-WoA-Raphael/woa-raphael/releases/download/Files/QUD.zip)

- [Patched MiFlash](https://github.com/new-WoA-Raphael/woa-raphael/releases/download/Files/PatchedMiflashRaphael.zip)

### Booting into EDL mode
> [!Note]
> If you're already in EDL mode, skip this step and continue with "Flashing your device"
- If your bootloader is unlocked and if you have access to fastboot mode, run ```fastboot oem edl``` to boot to EDL mode.

> If your bootloader is locked, or Android doesn't boot and you cannot access fastboot mode in any way, you will need to either remove the back of your device to short the EDL testpoints, or you will have to use an EDL cable
>
> (Not all EDL cables work and you may risk wasting money on one that won't, but this is probably still better than having to open your device).
- Look for a cable that has **V2** in its name, for example **Hydra V2 EDL Cable** or **V2 EDL Pro Cable**. Make sure it is for USB-C devices.
- Insert the cable into your device, then hold the button on the cable which may look like [this](https://t.me/nabuwoa/204867).
- It should boot you into EDL mode now.

### Installing EDL drivers
> If the device in **Device Manager** is called **QUSB_BULK_CID** or has a ⚠️ yellow warning triangle / question mark, and is located in any other category (for example **Other devices**), you need to install EDL drivers first.
- To install EDL drivers, extract the contents of **QUD.zip** somewhere, right click on **QUSB_BULK_CID**, click on **Update driver** and **Browse my computer for drivers**, then find and select the **QUD** folder.

### Flashing your device
- Open **XiaoMiFlash.exe** and grant it administrator access.
- Download the stock fastboot rom for your device (which should have a .tgz extension) and open it. Inside there should be a .tar file. Extract the contents of this .tar file into any folder).
- Copy **prog_ufs_firehose_sdm855_ddr.elf** from the patched miflash zip into the `images` folder of the fastboot ROM, overwriting the existing file.
- Click the **select** button in **XiaoMiFlash** and select this folder.
- Press **flash**.
- If you get a `write time out` error, hold the **power** + **volume down** button for +- 30 seconds to reboot EDL. After this press the **flash** button again.

#### Reboot your device
- After it says **flash done**, reboot your device by holding **power** or **power** + **volume down** for +- 14 seconds.
